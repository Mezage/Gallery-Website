The first file that should be ran is Input.py, this serves as the main homepage that allows users to add in artists, galleries, and images
*before adding an image, a gallery and artist for that image should exist first
*for any fields that require a numerical input from the user (eg. year), please only enter only numbers, no letters

Images can be viewed through the gallery or the sort tab
